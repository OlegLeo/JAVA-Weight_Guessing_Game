The goal of this project was to create, using OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), a game in which people are randomly chosen to try guess the weight of the bag. 

It is possible to create registers of new people, edit the person's information, delete and try to guess the weight.

From the people that were selected to play, the winner is the one who is closer to the weight, that was randomly generated, informing at the beginning of the game the interval (always being 150g, Ex: 4kg - 4.150kg)
